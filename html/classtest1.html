    <h3><u>WHAT IS WEB DEVELOPMENT</u></h3>
    <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). 
        Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. 
        A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>

    <h3><u>FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT</u></h3>
    <p><b>Front-end development</b>, also known as client-side development, is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front-end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.</p>

    <h3><u>BACK-END DEVELOPMENT</u></h3>
    <p><b>Back-end development</b>, also called server-side development, is the term used for the behind-the-scenes activities that happen when performing any operation on a website. It can be anything from logging in to your account or purchasing a watch from an online store. Back-end development usually consists of three parts: a server, an application, and a database. Back-end developers are responsible for building and maintaining the technology that powers those components, which enable the user-facing side of the website to even exist in the first place.</p>

    <h3><u>FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT</u></h3>
    <p><b>Full-stack development</b> refers to the development of both front end (client side) and back end (server side) portions of a web application. Full-stack developers are comfortable working with both back-end and front-end technologies. They can create a complete web application from start to finish, including designing the user interface, developing the server-side logic, and managing the database.</p>
